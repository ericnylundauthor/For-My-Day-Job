# For-My-Day-Job

After I get off work at Microsoft, I have to remember to stop by the North Bend library, I have some good books I want to pick up For Later. My sign-in will be easy enough, it's just my Github login, with the password being the first name of the old British author with my son's 7th grade English substitute teacher's last name.
